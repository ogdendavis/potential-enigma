Far future Game (in browser? Electron?)

Premise: Humanity has reached the stars, but we got there weird. Global warming went crazy, weather broke, governments failed, millions upon millions died from hunger or thirst or war, or the inability or unwillingness to put up with how shitty life had become. 

The cities that survived did so by becoming more and more self-sufficient. Polluted air was filtered, food was grown in any available space, closed-loop water systems were installed, trash was recycled into new products.

Eventually, even the more efficient cities began to fail as the temperature got too hot, the water too acidic, etc. Some cities began to enclose entire blocks, turning them into airtight bunkers (need better word). The rich and/or lucky holed up in these municipal bunkers, creating closed-off, self-sufficient city/states.

No one bunker was 100% isolated from the rest of the world, but many groups were completely missing something that humans absolutely must have to survive. Bunkers in the desert had zero water, and learned to filter and recycle 100% of the humidity inside to survive. Underground bunkers could access fresh water from aquifers, but had to produce light that would grow food and keep the people inside from going crazy. Etc. 

Eventually, some of the more successful groups started to expand beyond their original habitations. The earth was still all fucked up, so they still had to build encapsulated, self-sustaining habitats. As the more successful groups continued to expand, info was exchanged. And finally (figure out a specific story for this — why would they leave earth if they had working self-contained habitats? Religious persecution? Rich folk wanting to get away from the sulfury, burnt-earth smell?) one group put a bunch of different pieces of that info together in the form of a series of shipping-container-sized capsules, strapped them to a bunch of rockets, and shot them to the moon.

On the moon, people figured out how to do all the stuff they’d had to do on the broken earth in microgravity and without direct access to the earth’s abundant resources. It took a lot of time. Lots of people died.

Then, again, some people decided that the moon just wasn’t big enough for them, so they repeated the process, shooting a bunch of capsules into orbit around the moon and establishing humanity’s first permanent zero-gravity settlements.

Thus was humanity untethered from the earth: Not in a glorious triumph of science and progress, but with desperate ingenuity born from the need to survive an apocalypse of our own creation.

From moon orbit, something like civilization again began to prosper. Like in the “golden” age of European exploration, years-long expeditions went out in search of valuable minerals, or just to see what was out there. Small settlements were established around all of the planets in the solar system, and in the asteroid belt.

Einstein was right: faster-than-light travel is impossible in our universe. But humans can be made to hibernate, and without the need to escape a gravity well first, vessels can be constructed that exceed 99% of light speed. Mining facilities and tourist destinations in the far reaches of the solar system grew into cities and civilizations. 

And, again, some folks decided to leave. They gathered all of their family and friends into automated, self-sustaining arks (need a better word, “ark” is overused), aimed towards a distant star, and launched. Hundreds or thousands of terrestrial years later (but only dozens of years on the ship thanks to time dilation, and with the passengers having only aged a few months thanks to the hibernation drugs), they arrived to start new civilizations around new stars.

So, here’s the game premise: humanity destroyed the earth with greed and short-sightedness, but in the process of surviving that catastrophic fuck-up, developed the technology and learned the skills needed to become a truly space-faring species. Since FTL travel is an impossibility, there’s a massive time delay in the exchange of people and ideas between civilizations in different parts of the universe.

The player character is a person who has left one civilization and traveled solo to a different one. This is very rare, since the time/space gap means cultures are very different, and also it takes so long that by the time you arrive everyone you’ve ever known is long dead, and children are reading about the era in which you were born in history books. The in-game character must explore the new culture and figure out how to fit in, survive, and (hopefully, eventually) thrive. The player also wants to figure out why the character left their original civilization, and gets hints to this in the course of the game.

Needs more work. Will this function as a game? What are the actual game mechanics? What’s the scope? Is it all about exploring one new civilization, or is it a series, with the character jumping from civ to civ? Does the player discover something big about how the universe works? Do you encounter alien life, or signs of past alien life? Lots more to flesh out.

Tangental note: If humanity were a space-faring species as portrayed in most popular sci-fi (Humans living much or all of their lives on space ships or stations, with some time (a few days, up to periods of years) spent on planets.), I’m not sure they’d stick to a diurnal or shift-based concept of what constitutes a day. They might arrive at a more flexible concept of a person needing regular rest periods that make sense for the activities they need or want to do, but the specific pattern of those rest periods need not reflect the patterns of a planet or even have s regularly recurring pattern.

— Alternative format: A novel written entirely on the notes app of a phone, from a first person point of view (journal entries?) of a person in the universe.
— Could publish it in small installments on Apple Books. Probably not in “real time,” since that would be too slow.
— Could it be a diary? Create a character and publish sets of that characters journal entries.
— * Go meta? Publish the character’s journal entries on GitHub. Parallel narratives: the character’s journey through their life in the fictional universe, and the GitHub history that shows the nonfiction reality of a novice writer/artist learning to build a fictional world.
— This could scale! So I start building a fictional universe by writing a fictional first-person narrative set in that universe. I do that on GitHub, under an open-source license. Success is if the repo gets popular and starts getting contributions, and pull requests, and forks. It could even potentially grow into an ecosystem of related repos (fictional universes) and a closely related ecosystem of the git histories of those repos.
— My impulse is to think of how I could monetize this or turn it into a career. Resist that! The really cool and exciting thing about this is that it’s potentially a new art form that I could get involved with, and that would be awesome.

Ok, so now I’m going to just start a GitHub repo and copy this note in as the first commit, and we’ll go from there.
