# Repo as Art

This is my attempt at an art project. It's in the very early stages. Right now, I'm not even sure what it is.

## INTRO

I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing and what the inputs and outputs of this whole project even are. To help me with that, I'm setting up a GitHub Codespace to work in, and oganizing my work in that Codespace in a way that sets me up to work in the Codespace. It's all very meta, and fankly a bit confusing, so right now this README is aimed at an audience of one (me), and will help me remember what I'm doing with this project and how I'm doing it.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

This repo is set up as a virtual workspace that I can drop into to tinker with my art. In that workspace, this README is the note-to-self stuck to the wall by the door, reminding me of where I was last and what I wanted to do next. The top-level folders in this repo are like workstations or pieces of furniture within the workspace, and are named with the hope that future me will intuitively understand what station/bench/toolbox in the room to go to in order to find what he needs.

So, future me, here's how the workspace is laid out:

- **WIP** is the work surface - it's where I put what I'm working on at this exact moment
- **TODO** is a to-do list mixed with an on-deck circle. It's where I put the thing I want to work on next (after I'm done with what's in WIP), or a to-do list to keep me organized, or a combination of those things
- **JUNK** is a vitual junk drawer, filled with potentially useful things that I don't really have a place for but also don't want to get rid of
- **PUBLISH** contains things that are done that you want the world to be able to see, like a display shelf
- **PRIVATE** contains things that are done that you want to keep locked in a secure cabinet so you can control who sees it

Obviously, the structure described above will evolve quickly, so try to remember to keep this README updated as you update the project structure.

## GETTING STARTED
