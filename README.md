# Repo as Art

This is my attempt at an art project. It's in the very early stages. Right now, I'm not even sure what it is.

## Getting Started

1. Read this README
2. Do art

## Intro

This repo is set up as a virtual workspace that I can drop into to tinker with my art. In that workspace, this README is the note-to-self stuck to the wall by the door, reminding me of where I was last and what I wanted to do next.

The workspace has two rooms: a public gallery and a private office. The office is private, and its contents are only visible to someone who has the key (access to the private repo). The gallery is a public work and display space.

The idea is to do almost all of the work in the gallery (public space), and to put only things that really *need* to be private in the office.

_Note: It's woth remembering that since this is a public repo, the gallery/office metaphor breaks down: From a practical point of view, just remember that anything that's not in the private folder is published publicly on GitHub._

## Galley Organization

The top-level folders in the gallery are like workstations or pieces of furniture within the room, and are named with the hope that future me will intuitively understand what station/bench/toolbox in the room to go to in order to find what he needs.

So, future me, here's how the gallery is laid out:

- **WIP** is the work surface - it's where I put what I'm working on at this exact moment
- **TODO** is a to-do list mixed with an on-deck circle. It's where I put the thing I want to work on next (after I'm done with what's in WIP), or a to-do list to keep me organized, or a combination of those things
- **JUNK** is a vitual junk drawer, filled with potentially useful things that I don't really have a place for but also don't want to get rid of
- **SHELF** contains things you just put on the shelf for you (or anybody else in the gallery) to look at

Obviously, the structure described above will evolve quickly, so try to remember to keep this README updated as you update the project structure.

## A note about the pivate folder

The private folder is installed as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), linked to the private repository [private-potential-enigma](https://github.com/ogdendavis/private-potential-enigma/)
