  "name": "The First Bunker",
  "vision_statement": "2184: A prepper in his illegal bunker in the Laurentides Wildlife Preserve outside of Quebec City is convinced that a series of riots in the city due to food and housing shortages caused by a wave of American (USA) refugees will escalate into a full-blown class war. He seals himself and his extended family in the bunker to wait out the violence. He's proven wrong: The riots die down when NATO ships arrive with food relief. But he's nervous enough about the simmering tension that he moves his family into the bunker full-time. They leave the blast door open during the day, tend gardens both above-ground and in the bunker, and occasionally drive into town to stock up on perishable supplies. A historical note at the end informs the  reader that when an actual shooting war does break out in the Rockies, friends join the family to form a small community based around the bunker. The bunker expands and the community grows for the following decade, eventually becoming the world's first completely underground city when the council voted to seal the doors permanently after losing contact with Montreal during the Appalachian War of 2196. (The council thought the city destroyed or lost to the Mainers, but actually deferred maintenance on the city's satellite array led to a cascading failure that caused a communications blackout for over two weeks. Montral wasn't actually destroyed until it was abandoned due to levee failure, two years later.)",
  "output": "Short story in the third person. Style is of a nonfiction article based on the protagonist's journal, which was recently discovered by historians. Article published a few hundred years after the events depicted therein."
